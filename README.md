This example creates the content repository and triggers the deployment of the front-end react UI hosted on Amplify automatically.

## Prerequisites
Prior to deployment, issue command `aws configure` and then follow the prompts to setup your AWS credentials and define the target account and region for the deployment.

## Build
To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
npm install
npm run build
```

This will install the AWS CDK, the necessary dependencies, and then build your TypeScript files and your CloudFormation template.

## Deploy

1. Run `cdk bootstrap` to bootstrap the stack and create the S3 bucket that will store the jobs' scripts.  
2. Run `cdk deploy`. This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account. 

After the deployment, browse to the Amplify hosted application URL printed in the stack outputs.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run `cdk synth`, then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.
